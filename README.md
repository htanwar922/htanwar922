# Projects
## DLMS/COSEM
- [DLMS/COSEM implementation on Linux (Ubuntu, RaspberryPi)][DLMS-COSEM]
  - Implemented Register class in fork from [EPRI:DLMS/COSEM] in collaboration with [github:sudeshna]
  - Implemented a Data Compression algorithm in Python and integrated with the inter-host DLMS/COSEM communication using TCP/IP and shared memory approaches for inter-process communication.
  - Implemented the Data Compression algorithm in C/C++ using TNT Matrix libraries. This allowed implementation of the complete application in C/C++ completely, and a seamless transition of the algorithm to STM32 implementation later on.
  - Deployed 10 RaspberryPi-based DLMS/COSEM-enabled smart meters around IIT Delhi campus.
  - Deployed a DLMS/COSEM-enabled Head-End System on Linux VMs hosted on IIT Delhi Cloud - _Baadal_ - for collecting data from the meters at r intervals and store in MongoDB database.
- [DLMS/COSEM implementation on STM32F207ZG][DLMS-COSEM_STM32]
  - Modified Linux libmodbus library to integrate to STM32 application, exposing read, write and delay functions for custom handling of modbus requests/responses.
  - Implemented ESP8266 libraries in two different ways to integrate with multi-threaded STM32 DLMS/COSEM application in collaboration with [github:venus696].
- [MERN website for displaying smart meters data][IoT-Cloud]
  - Hosted on Linux VMs on IIT Delhi Cloud - _Baadal_ - accessible over IITD intranet for displaying data collected from the deployed smart meters.
  - The website is written for two projects - Air Pollution Monitoring Device (APMD) and Smart Meters (SM).
  - The website allows selecting a date-range or a rolling-plot option, and desired metrics from a list of available metrics.
  - OpenLayers used to render a map of IIT Delhi with an additional layer with overlays to show checkboxes with location-popups marking locations of the installed smart meters around the campus.
- [DLMS-Wireshark for displaying expanded (array and structure in) DLMS _normal_ packets in Wireshark][DLMS-Wireshark]
  - Modified fork from [matousp:dlms-analysis] github repository in lua to expand and display the COSEM structure and array (ASN.1 format) DLMS _normal_ packets in Wireshark.

## Vehicle Control Unit
- Developed Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) for Formula Student Electric race car as per Formula Green 2020 rule-book:
  - Shutdown circuit to control and cut power supply from battery to motor controller (and motor).
  - Several PCBs (schematic and layout design, and soldering) to control the shutdown circuit.
  - Programming STM32F103RB controller for algorithms to implement some controls in and out of rule-book.
  - SPI communication of the STM32 board with an ADC and an nRF24L01+ board.

## Cross-lingual text classification
- Sentiment classification for a target language for which only small amounts of labelled data is available using transfer learning on a source language for which large datasets for the same are available:
  - Sentiment classification training of base layers of the Adversarial Network model on source language datasets.
  - Adversarial training with language detector branch of the Adversarial Network model.
- The model was implemented on Tensorflow-Keras framework for Amazon reviews dataset with English as source language and French as target language.
